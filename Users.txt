                    While  various  UNIX  utilities   have   been
                    designed  to take advantage of the CRT screen
                    (rather than line-oriented systems) electron-
                    ic  mail  systems  haven't "caught the wave".
                    This document presents Elm,  a  sophisticated
                    full-screen  mail system for interactive use.
                    Elm offers all  the  features  of  /bin/mail,
                    Berkeley  Mail,  uumail,  NMail  and the AT&T
                    Mail family of UNIX mailers (namely PMX/TERM)
                    in a unified and intuitive fashion.

          1....  Introduction

          The UNIX(R) operating system was originally written  on  a  small
          PDP machine, to work with teletypewriters.  Consequently, all the
          original software for the operating system  was  written  with  a
          "tty"  in mind; with line oriented interfaces, rather than screen
          oriented.

          Gradually this began to change, and, with  the  addition  of  the
          Berkeley  vi  visual shell to the ed line editor, the trend began
          to be brought to the attention of UNIX  systems  designers.   And
          yet,  this transition has seemed too subtle for many software en-
          gineers, and so precious few UNIX programs are available designed
          to exploit the entire CRT screen.

          Consequently, after becoming more and more disenchanted with  the

          Elm Users Guide                                       Version 2.4





9          Elm Users Guide                                       Version 2.4


9          existing electronic mail facilities (binmail and  Berkeley  Mail)
          Dave  Taylor  decided to undertake creating his own system.  Once
          the ball was rolling  it  became  quite  difficult  not  to  keep
          enhancing  it, especially as he and the Elm Development Group be-
          came more and more familiar with various different mail  systems,
          but  the  result, we hope, is a solid, unified interface to elec-
          tronic mail suitable for almost any environment.

          One thing that sets the Elm mail system off from  other  packages
          is  that it comes with an extensive documentation set, including;
          The Elm Users Guide, which  you're  holding,  The  Elm  Reference
          Guide,  The  Elm  Alias  Users Guide, The Elm Filter System Users
          Guide, The Elm Forms Mode Guide, and The Elm Configuration Guide.
          The names of each indicate what they discuss (not unreasonably).

          This particular document contains; this introduction, a  tutorial
          session  with the mailer, a discussion of non-interactive uses of
          Elm, a brief foray into the Elm utilities, and  finally,  credits
          and references.

          The Elm Reference Guide contains a much more in-depth  discussion
          of all the possible options available within the Elm environment,
          including the .elm/elmrc file, the available outbound  mail  pro-
          cessing  features, a section for expert users, suggestions on de-
          bugging strange installations, and many other useful topics.

          The Elm Alias Users Guide is the place to go to learn  about  the
          format  of  the  .elm/aliases.text  file  and the associated data
          files, system aliases, and other related topics.

          One of the more innovative features of  Elm  is  the  ability  to
          transmit  and  receive  "forms" (as defined by the AT&T Mail sys-
          tem).  To learn about how to create and reply to forms you should
          refer to The Elm Forms Mode Guide.

          If you find yourself getting too  much  mail  delivered  in  your
          mailbox,  you  might  be a good candidate for the filter program.
          To learn more about what this program is and how to use it please
          consult The Elm Filter System Users Guide.

          Finally, if you're working with the actual source  code  and  are
          interested  in  what  all  the locally configured options are and
          mean, please see The Elm Configuration  Guide.   It  is  strongly
          suggested  that  all  system administrators and people installing
          the system print out the local sysdefs.h file and have  it  handy
          while reading the configuration guide.

          The recommended order of learning the Elm system is to skim  this
          guide  until  you  feel confident enough to start up the program.
          Once that's reached, use it!  Soon you'll  find  areas  that  you
          need  to  expand into, and you can achieve that by going into the
          options screen within Elm and changing your user level according-
          ly.   After  a while, sit down again and read through this guide.
          You should have a couple  of  "aha!"  intuitive  flashes.   After

9          another period of time, you're ready to delve into the real power
          of the system and read the reference guide.   The  other  manuals
          should be read as the need arises.

          In any case, the system should be usable without reading  any  of
          the documentation!

          Any comments or problems with any of  the  documentation  or  the
          program  itself  are welcome; if you can't get electronic mail to
          the Elm Development Group, please feel free instead to drop me  a
          note via the overland mail address in the title page.


          2....  The Main System

          Upon entry to the program, the main screen will be  displayed  as
          below:

          You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character;
          d)elete or u)ndelete mail, m)ail a message, r)eply or f)orward mail, q)uit
          To read a message, press <return>.  j = move down, k = move up, ? = help
           Command : @

7          __________________________________________________________________

          There are a number of things  to  notice  about  this,  the  main
          screen;


            +o
             Most likely, on your computer the message  currently  "active"
             will be displayed in an inverse bar rather than being delimit-
             ed by the two character arrow as here.  It's nothing to  worry
             about;  displaying  inverse  video  is just quite difficult on
             printable guides!


            +o
             The first line on the screen always displays the name  of  the
             current  folder, the number of messages in the folder, and the
             current Elm version number.



          October 1, 1992                                            Page 3





9          Elm Users Guide                                       Version 2.4


9            +o
             The arrow ("->") or inverse video  bar  will  always  indicate
             which is the current message.


            +o
             The first field that appears associated with each  message  is
             the status field.  This can be blank (as with most of the ones
             above, or can have any combination of the following:

             The first character signifies temporary status:

                   E       for an expired message
                   N       for a new message
                   O       for an old (i.e. not new but not read) message
                   D       for a deleted message

             The second character which signifies permanent status:

                   C       for confidential mail
                   U       for urgent mail
                   P       for a private message
                   A       for messages that have an action associated with them
                   F       for a form letter
                   M       for a MIME compliant message

             The third character of the status field can be a '+' to  indi-
             cate that the message is tagged too.


            +o
             Continuing from left to right, the next field is  the  message
             number.   For  the  most  part you can ignore these unless you
             want to quickly move to  a  specific  message  (as  we'll  see
             later).


            +o
             The date associated with each message is  typically  the  date
             the person actually sent the message.


            +o
             The next field displayed indicates whom the message  is  from.
             Elm  will  try to display the full name of the person who sent
             the message, rather than the their return address or  computer
             login.   Some  systems  don't  generate  the  correct headers,
             though, hence messages like numbers 2 and 8, where it's  their
             return address.


            +o
             The number in parentheses is the total number of lines in  the
             message.

9            +o
             The final field is the subject of the  message.   Notice  that
             messages  might  not  have  any subject, as in messages #9 and
             #10.


            +o
             A maximum of ten messages are displayed at one time.819  Further
             into  the  document  we'll  learn how to change "pages" in the
             folder.


            +o
             The three line menu display will always indicate the  relevant
             commands.   There  are actually two possible menus that can be
             displayed, based on the user level as set from either the  op-
             tions  screen or the .elm/elmrc file.  The alternate menu, for
             more advanced users, lists more options;

             |=pipe, !=shell, ?=help, <n>=set current to n, /=search pattern
             a)lias, C)copy, c)hange folder, d)elete, e)dit, f)orward, g)roup reply, m)ail,
             n)ext, o)ptions, p)rint, r)eply, s)ave, t)ag, q)uit, u)ndelete, or e(x)it


            +o
             Finally, the '@' character indicates where  the  cursor  would
             be, awaiting your input.


          The typical action at this point is to use the  <return>  key  to
          read the current message, which will clear the screen and display
          the current message:

          an even greater number displayed.

          subtle  -  a  forwarded  message  is from you, with the
          original message included, whereas a bounced message is
          still from the original sender.

          But let's go back to our example and see some of  this  at  work,
          shall we?

          We were reading the message from  Larry  and  the  screen  looked
          like:

           Dave,
                Just wanted to drop you a brief note to see what was going on with
           you this afternoon.  Life here has been the usual fun and games...
                            Ah well, off to the great wilds beyond the desk!

          From this point let's go ahead and reply to the message.   To  do
          this,  we can use the reply command.  To do this, we type 'r' and
          the last few lines change to something like:

          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          Command: Reply to message                  Copy message? (y/n) @


          To which we decide that we don't need the text of this message in
          our  new one, so we reply no by pressing the 'n' key.  The bottom
          part of the window then changes to:

          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          Command: Reply to message                       To: Larry Fenske
          Subject: Re: Hello there@


          At this point we can either decide to enter a  new  subject  (you
          could  use  either backup word (<control>-W) or backup line (this
          is the  same  as  your  "line  kill"  character,  <control>-X  or
          <control>-U  usually))  or go with this one by pressing <return>.

          There's no one we want to have receive copies of this message, so
          we'll just press <return> again to indicate this.

          Once you've answered these questions the  program  will  put  you
          into  your  favorite editor and let you compose a response.  When
          you're done it then asks:

          Please choose one of the following options by parenthesized letter: @
               e)dit message, edit h)eaders, s)end it, or f)orget it.

          Since we're just interested in sending  the  message  out,  we'll
          choose the send option and press 's'.  The program then sends the
          message, indicating that by the line below saying:

              Sending mail...

          then putting at the bottom of the screen ``Mail sent!'' and  giv-
          ing us the prompt:

          Pretty easy, isn't it?  Let's continue by going back to the  main
          screen  pressing the 'i' key to request the index.  The screen is
          then:

          Let's go ahead and read the message from kevin (message #6) since
          it  has  some  sort  of  action associated with it anyway.  To do

          Well, it turns out that we don't, but a friend of ours  does,  so
          let's forward the message to them by pressing 'f':

          Command: Forward message         Edit outgoing message (y/n) ? @


          No need to edit it, so let's answer no with 'n':

          Command: Forward message        Edit outgoing message (y/n) ? No
          To: @

          We type in the address of the person we're forwarding to (in this
          case usenet) and press <return>:

          Command: Forward message                              To: usenet
          Subject: More software requests (fwd)@

          To which we again press <return> to  take  the  default  subject.
          Elm  asks for any possible copy recipients, asks us if we're sure
          we want to send it, and shoots it off.

          Enough mail for now, however, so we just exit by pressing the 'x'
          key  at  the "Command:" prompt and the program drops us back into
          our shell.

          As you can see, it's quite easy to use the Elm system, so  rather
          than  continue with our example, let's look at some other aspects
          of the program.


          3....  Non----Interactive Uses of Elm

          Before we go ahead and discuss the Elm utilities, it's worth not-
          ing  that  there  are a couple of other ways to use the main mail


          October 1, 1992                                           Page 10





9          Elm Users Guide                                       Version 2.4


9          system, namely to "send only" and to send files (batchmail).

          To send a message to someone without any of the associated  over-
          head  of reading in a mail folder, you can invoke the mailer with
          the name(s) of the people to send to.  For example:

               $ elm dave_taylor

          Elm then prompts for Subject, Copies, and then drops you in  your
          editor  (defined  in the .elm/elmrc file) to compose the message.
          When composition is complete, the program  verifies  transmission
          then terminates.

          Elm also supports batch type mailing, of files and so on, by  us-
          ing the following command:

               $ elm dave_taylor <<<< help....c

          which reads in the file and transmits it to the specified user.

          A subject may be specified with "-s subject" as an option to  Elm
          in either "send only" or "batch" modes, as in:

               $ elm ----s """"File help....c,,,, as promised"""" dave_taylor <<<< help....c

          Elm also has an option to specify that a certain file be used  as
          the initial text of the message.  This makes it easier to use Elm
          with other programs that interface with a mailer.  Use "-i  file"
          as an option to Elm in "send only" mode.  For example, to specify
          to rn to use Elm as the mailer, define the following in RNINIT:

               -EMAILPOSTER="elm -i %h -s \"Re: %S\" %t"

          See the man page for rn(1) or the newsreader  you  use  for  more
          specific information.



          4....  The Elm Utilities

          The Elm mail system is really much more than a single program for
          reading  and writing mail.  It's a unified environment for intel-
          ligently dealing with electronic  correspondence.   As  a  conse-
          quence, it contains a number of other programs to aid in the easy
          processing of "email", including the following;


           answer   An answering-machine transcription program.  Please see
                    the  manual  entry  for  more information on how to use
                    this program.


           checkalias
                    A script for checking aliases simply.

9           elmalias A tool to obtain information on defined aliases.


           listalias
                    A script to produce sorted listings of aliases.


           messages A script that lists  the  number  of  messages  in  the
                    specified folder.  Suitable for login scripts and such.


           newmail  This program monitors a mailbox or set of mailboxes and
                    can  output notification of new mail in one of two pos-
                    sible formats; either:

                         >> New mail from Jimmy Carter -- Urgent matters of state
                         >> New mail from joe@ucbvax.arpa -- Did I hear someone say PARTY??

                    if running as newmail or:

                         Jimmy Carter -- Urgent matters of state
                         joe@ucbvax.arpa -- Did I hear someone say PARTY??

                    if running as wnewmail.  BSD Users will find this is  a
                    far superior biff program.


           wnewmail This is the same program as newmail, but has  different
                    defaults if invoked this way.


           readmsg  This handy little program can  be  used  in  two  ways.
                    First  off,  it  can  be used to easily read a specific
                    message in the incoming mailbox, specified  by  ordinal
                    number,  by  a string that the message contains, by the
                    metacharacter '$' which represents the last message  in
                    the  folder,  or  '*' which matches all the messages in
                    the folder.

                    For example;

                         $ readmsg 4 5 9 |||| lpr

                    would generate a printout, sans superfluous headers, of
                    the fourth, fifth and ninth messages in your mailbox.

                         $ readmsg Carter |||| page

                    would be a fast way to read what 'ole Jimmy has to say,
                    and

                         $ readmsg ----h hear someone say

                    would list, including  all  the  message  headers,  the

           frm      Similar to the Berkeley from command,  this  will  give
                    you  a  "table  of contents" or a summary of either the
                    current mailbox or a mailbox  of  your  choice.    It's
                    useful  to  see  what  mail  is pending, or what's in a
                    mailbox.  If used with the "-n" option, it will  number
                    each  message  in  a  way compatible with the arguments
                    readmsg expects to get, too!


           newalias This is used to install new user/group aliases.  Please
                    see The Elm Alias Users Guide for further information.


           fastmail Sometimes you want to have a batchmailing  system  that
                    works  as  quickly  as  possible,  not  bothering  with
                    aliases or any of the other "deluxe" features  of  Elm.
                    An example of this would be if you have a large mailing
                    list for a newsletter, say.  This command, fastmail, is
                    designed  just for that purpose.  It avoids the lengthy
                    startup time of Elm while still generating  valid  RFC-
                    822859 mail.  Please see the manual entry for more infor-
                    mation on this command.


          5....  Credits and So on ---- Elm''''s early years from Dave Taylor

          This mailer has been evolving over the past few  years  with  in-
          valuable  comments  on the interface and general mail issues from
          the following people; Jim Davis, Steve Wolf (or should  that  say
          Steve!! Wolf!!!! perhaps?), Larry Fenske, Rob Sartin, John Dilley
          and Carl Dierschow.

          For the Berkeley implementation, lots of help came from both John
          Lebovitz and Ken Stone.

          For the Amdahl/UTS implementation, thanks to Scott  McGregor  and
          Stan Isaacs.

          For the Sun problems, Dave England in Lancaster (UK)  turned  out
          to be "bloody useful", as he would no doubt say.

          The Pyramid version is due to the work of  Steve  Malone  of  the
          University of Washington.

          A number of other people have been amazingly disciplined  at  re-
          porting  problems and (usually, much to my relief) indicating the
          fixes needed, especially Guy Hillyer,  Bruce  Townsend  and  Eric

9          Negaard.

          There have been many, many others, too numerous to mention,  that
          have  inspired  me with questions like "Why can't Elm..." or "Why
          does it ..." or "Can we make it..." too.  A  loud  round  of  ap-
          plause and an enthusiastic THANK YOU to you all!!

          Also helpful was the ability to have my "own" machine to close up
          the many many iterative loops that this software has gone through
          - since being on a big multi-user machine tends to slow  it  down
          to a standstill.  For that, I thank Hewlett-Packard Colorado Net-
          works Division for their initial support, and now HP Laboratories
          for the wonderful working environment that I have here (more than
          any one person is safe having, I suspect).

          Mailers that have influenced the  design  and  implementation  of
          Elm, for better or worse, include the following;


           /bin/mail
                    The most basic of mailers, this one was simply the  ex-
                    ample  of  how not to force the user to interact with a
                    program.


           Berkeley Mail
                    A surprisingly  sophisticated  mailer,  especially  the
                    version  with 4.3 BSD, Berkeley Mail still suffers from
                    the tendency to force the user to know too  much  about
                    the  system, and also lacks a friendly, non-cryptic in-
                    terface for the large subset of the population that use
                    UNIX but aren't interested in becoming a "hacker".


           MH       This is another  nifty  mailer.   The  main  difference
                    between  this and the other mailers about is that it is
                    a discrete set of programs rather than a single unified
                    interface.   This is quite useful for those people that
                    receive lots of mail and are willing to spend some time
                    learning  the  intricacies  of the program.  It's quite
                    powerful, but again, misses some of the basic  friendly
                    features the majority of users are interested in.


           dmail    A sort of mutated cross between MH and  Berkeley  Mail,
                    it  was this program that convinced me to implement the
                    limit functions.


           NMail    A part of the HP AI Workstation  Software  Environment,
                    this  program  hints at the power that mailers could be
                    given to help deal with mail in a quick and intelligent
                    fashion.   Most  of what it can do, and a lot more, are
                    therefore part of Elm.  Indubitably.   And  quite  fast

9                    too!


           PMX/TERM Part of the AT&T Mail package, a single glance at  this
                    interface convinced me that a PC interface, with almost
                    half of the screen taken up by  a  silly  function  key
                    mapping,  is  most certainly not the way to do things!!
                    On the other hand, it also shows that the "forms"  mode
                    can be quite nicely integrated into a more sophisticat-
                    ed mailer.


           fmail    A nickel addition to the /bin/mail program to add  some
                    rudimentary  screen  interface  stuff, this nonetheless
                    interesting mailer is part of the AT&T Toolchest.


           Laurel   A program only available within Xerox PARC, this was an
                    interesting  early  attempt  at  a graphics based full-
                    screen mail program.  The one, perhaps trivial, part of
                    the  interface I really like was the fact that it would
                    cross out a message that was marked for deletion.   One
                    day  when  we  get real graphics and the ability to use
                    them in a facility (not too) like termcap, perhaps  Elm
                    will do this too!


           Mailtool Part of the Sun distribution package, this program is a
                    really  nice  example  of what can be done by putting a
                    smart shell  on  top  of  a  dumb  program  -  it  uses
                    /bin/mail  for  all the "dirty work".  Other than that,
                    it's  not  a  particularly  interesting  interface   or
                    mailer,  and it certainly doesn't add much functionali-
                    ty!


           Metamail What can I say?  This isn't even a real mailer,869 but is
                    just what I dream of as an interface to mail in the fu-
                    ture.  A program that works sort of  like  HAL  did  in
                    2001:  A  Space Odyssey - where it interrupts me as ap-
                    propriate for important mail, and can answer inane  and
                    other  queries  itself  according  to  what I teach it.
                    Maybe Elm, by some  sort  of  groupmind  metamorphosis,
                    will  change  into  that someday.  Maybe not.  Maybe no
                    one bothers to read this far into the document!!

          Finally, it's also been a very useful  experience  overall,  con-
          firming  my  beliefs that iterative software design and keeping a
          close watch on users (not to mention an open mind  and  mailbox!)
          improves  a product manyfold.  Comments, feedback and bug reports

          metamail, from Nathaniel Borenstein of Bellcore.

          6....  Credits and So on Part II ---- The Usenet Elm Development Group

          As coordinator of the Elm Development Group, I must  add  to  the
          credits.   This  group  of volunteers has taken the Elm code from
          Dave Taylor and added features, made it  more  robust,  and  more
          portable.

          For getting the Usenet Elm  group  going,  for  without  which  I
          wouldn't  be writing this, thanks to Greg Hackney at Southwestern
          Bell Telephone Co.

          For the Configuration system and  its  newer  Dist  2.0  version,
          thanks are due to Larry Wall of JPL-NASA.

          For his over two hundred sets of changes to version 2.2, Elm owes
          a lot to Rob Bernardo who was at Pacbell at that time.

          The ability to run Elm at all on Intel 286 machines owes a lot to
          the insistent nudging of the coordinator by Chip Salzenberg, Chip
          Rosenthal, and Tim Evans.

          For getting us the rights to use the news macros  and  converting
          all the documentation over to those macros, thanks to Mike Brown.

          For pushing us into the '90s and forcing the issues  of  NLS  and
          foreign  language  support, I thank Jan Saell of Administration &
          Systemkonsult AB along with Larry Philps of SCO Canada.  I'd also
          like  to  thank  the  many  current  and prior members of the Elm
          development and testing groups.  The list  varies  from  time  to
          time as people come and go.  Also, to all the Elm users out there
          who send in patches.  The group can use all  the  extra  help  it
          gets.   As  a  postScript,  if you wish to join the group, all it
          takes is some time to work on things, and to ask.

          Syd Weinstein, Elm Coordinator.
